                    If all goes to plan, we will move on to design and create our ultimate vision, The First to Market Racing Metaverse! As of now, we look forward to creating a metaverse from scratch where racers will have the capability to race in virtual reality, using hyper realistic graphics to create the most immersive experience possible. Future drops will release to allow access to more player/racers/collectors. We aim to be the leaders in the virtual racing world, where Racing and Car Enthusiasts may come as close as possible to the real racing world.

                    Merchandise may very well be available to holders after the 10,000 Car drop. However we plan to release merchandise exclusively to holders after we create the metaverse. We want holders to be able to create a special community where we all take care of one another. By wearing our merch, you ae not only representing and supporting the brand, but you are also building a community that watches out for each other. We want people to not onnly connect virtually, but also physically in the real world. We want our community to become a mainstream network that benefits its members.

                    The sky is the limit at this point. We will be mainly working on coming out with great features, such as creating a virtual space to represent your garage, where you can hold your collection. Selling NFT parts to upgrade your NFT car, which also raises the value. Allowing racers to receive sponsorships and put verified brands on their cars to make another line of income. We really want the metaverse to encompass the racing world, and more, by making the possibilities available to all holders.

                    We hope to come out with many more projects where previous holders, and all of our very first supporters will receive exclusive access to projects, merch, and events. We see ourselves not only limiting ourselves to cars, but also branching out to everything to do with racing. We want people to be able to own their own tracks, where racers can have memberships and pay the track to race for huge prizes, including crypto. We see ourselves branching out all the way from motorcycle racing, to bobsledding. We aren't afraid to venture to places that are tough, we want to be the top of our market, we want to be the NFL, UFC, and the NBA of Racing. When people hear our name, we want people to hear racing.
